# Hengdang Protocol

Hengdang is an end-to-end encrypted cloud file storage and collaboration protocol that prioritizes digital sovereignty and privacy. Users host their own data while maintaining complete cryptographic control over their files.

## Motivation

Current cloud storage solutions like Google Drive require users to trust service providers with their data. This creates privacy concerns and vendor lock-in. Hengdang aims to provide a sovereign alternative where users host their own data while maintaining strong encryption and the ability to selectively share with others.

## Core Principles

1. **Digital Sovereignty**: Users control their own data and encryption keys
2. **Zero Trust**: Servers never see unencrypted data
3. **Cryptographic Privacy**: Strong end-to-end encryption for all content
4. **Selective Sharing**: Granular permissions with cryptographic enforcement
5. **Self Hosting**: Users can choose to run their own homeserver
6. **Credible Exit**: Users can migrate servers and take their files with them.
